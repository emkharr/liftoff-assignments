# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Our app will be a personal guide to US National Parks. It will provide users with information like accessibility, attractions, and current updates about parks, allow them to build a "dream parks" list and track visited parks. Users will also be able to keep record of their experiences at each park though uploaded notes, photos, and checklists. The idea stemmed from inconsistencies within individual park websites and a desire to make parks feel more personal and accessible to visitors. By adding checklist features to the app, we also build a sense of personal challenge within the app, encouraging users to check every park and hike off their list.  
### Features
- User login: Users will be able to log in to the application and view or edit their lists and notes from a profile page. 
- Search: Users will be able to search for parks by name, state, topic, or by exploring a map.
- Notes: Logged in users will be able to write timestamped notes about their park visits, which will be viewable from the relevant park's profile page and the user's account page.
- Lists: Logged in users will be able to create, track, and edit lists of parks visited and parks they would like to visit. Within each park profile, users will have the option to check off completed hikes.
